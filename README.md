This repo contains mainly codes for homework from PhD course at INSEAD

Session 1: CAPM and several puzzles.

Session 2: Model testing, FF 3 factor model, both time series and cross-sectional regressions. Codes include GRS and FamaMacbeth.

Session 3: GMM and conditional CAPM testing. 
Data involve FF factors, FF portfolios, St. Louis Fed on default spread, BEA labor income growth.
- I first check the existence of predictability of bond spread on market return. So far the result seems pretty suspicious. I also notice the abnormal spikes in the early 1990s of labor income growth.
