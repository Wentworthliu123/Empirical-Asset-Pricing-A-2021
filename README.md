# Empirical-Asset-Pricing-A-2021
This repo contains mainly codes for homework from PhD course at INSEAD

Session 1: CAPM and several puzzles.

Session 2: Model testing, FF 3 factor model, both time series and cross-sectional regressions. Codes include GRS and FamaMacbeth.

Session 3: GMM and conditional CAPM testing. 
Data involve FF factors, FF portfolios, St. Louis Fed on default spread, BEA labor income growth.
- I first check the existence of predictability of bond spread on market return. So far the result seems pretty suspicious. I also notice the abnormal spikes in the early 1990s of labor income growth. I am also interested in replicating the P/D ratio predictability test summarized by Cochrane, here is a useful reference from 

  -[RichardMM](https://github.com/RichardMM/Cochrane-the-dog-that-did-not-bark-using-python/blob/master/empiric%20finance.py);
  - and there is data and matlab code available from [Grumpy economist](https://www.johnhcochrane.com/the-dog-that-didnt-bark);
  - Cochrane's presentation on it at [NYU](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~svnieuwe/pdfs/PhDPres2007/pres3_2.pdf);
  - An old code on testing with Shiller's data [Christophj](https://christophj.github.io/replicating/r/replicating-cochrane-2008/)
 
There are notes from Cochrane explaining the predictability in details.
